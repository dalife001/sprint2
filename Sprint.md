## Sprint 2 Goal

In Sprint 2, the team will focus on implementing an API-first architecture by connecting the frontend and backend through well-defined APIs. 
Security mechanisms will be added to protect the application, and a banking mock environment using TrueLayer Mock Bank will be integrated for testing purposes. 
On the frontend side, the Sprint 1 prototype will be transformed into a functional and tangible user interface.
